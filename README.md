# Blender notes

These are reminders for myself on how to do stuff in Blender.


## Editor types

The contents of an area is determined by the selected editor type.

- [Node editor](./Node_editor/)

- [Outliner](./Outliner/)

- [Properties](./Properties/)


## Keyboard controls

`Alt + a` plays animation.

`Alt + Shift + a` plays in reverse.

`Shift + Right` jumps to last frame.
