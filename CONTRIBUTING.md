# Contributing

Please feel free to open issues on anything in this repo!
I would greatly appreciate any corrections or tips on better ways to do
things.

I will probably reorder pages as I add more information and learn more
features, so it will likely make a poor reference for others.
Please keep that in mind if you are thinking of contributing.
