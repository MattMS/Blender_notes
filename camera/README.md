## Focus on an object

With the camera selected, choose "Constraints" from the "Properties"
panel.

Click "Add Object Constraint", then "Track To" from under the
"Tracking" heading.

Set "Target" to the object to look at.

Set "To" to "-Z" and "Up" to "Y".

The camera should maintain focus on the object while moving either.
